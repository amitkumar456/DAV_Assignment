Usually in Data Science - we prefer to do things in a "Notebook" for the ease of visibility - eg. Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks for PYTHON. Colab is an cloud hosted notebook which runs python. I would highly recommend you to do all your analysis in a Notebook (also called code-chunks in R). You would find it really easy to do your analysis in the notebooks. (Normally Programmers used something called an IDE).

Google Colab - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/index.htm

Python:
1) Python Basics + Numpy Basics (Used to perform Numerical Computations and Matrix/ Vector Algebra) (Wouldn't really be used in the assignment) & Pandas Basics (Data Manipulation) - https://www.learnpython.org/en/ (upto Pandas Basics)

3) Intermediate Pandas - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_groupby.htm
https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp

2) Matplotlib/ Seaborn (for plotting) - https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial

R:

2) ggplot2 - https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html

A Few more Pointers : If you are stuck at any point - due to some error, copy that error and paste it into google - there is a really high chance that someone on Stackoverflow would have faced a similar issue and there would already be a solution for the same!
Also - you don't need to learn both languages, pick one learn from the tutorials and make the project using those languages.

Every Data Science Project Contains atleast 2 pipelines. In, all, there are 4 pipelines in Data Science.
1) Exploratory Data Analysis:
This is where you actually take stock of your data, explore the data - if there are any null values, which features are categorical, which features are continuous, which features are temporal (related to time), check if there is an optimum diversity in the data (not too less - all categories are same, not too much - each datapoint in a different category)

2) Descriptive Data Analysis
Can you manipulate the data to answer questions and gain insights from the data and hopefully be able to convey it in a pictorial way.

3) Predictive Data Analysis (A fancy way of referring to Machine Learning)
Does the data help in predicting anything?

4) Prescriptive Analysis 
Can you actually use the data and help provide various solutions/strategies to the stakeholders to improve their performance (depending upon the task). Also you won't reach the 3rd and the 4th stage for many problems.

You might notice that for each question there may be sub-questions. If you are creative enough, you can actually answer all those questions with the help of just a single plot. Also you need to consider if the plot you make is getting too complicated for a layperson to comprehend. So you need to strike an optimum balance between information vs interpretability of the plots.
